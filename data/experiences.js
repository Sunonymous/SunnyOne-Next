The quality really is fabulous and I deepened my knowledge of the inner mechanisms of React through his instruction.

                'Captioning Agent, Mentor Assistant',
                (<p>Here I provided a telephone captioning service to customers with hearing loss. For a time, I worked as a mentor, assisting new hire training and helping struggling employees improve their performance.</p>),
                (<p>Enter CaptionCall. I remember it just like it was {new Date().getFullYear() - 2014} years ago... CaptionCall is a company which provides captioning service for telephone calls. I was one of countless Captioning Agents working the service. I signed a confidentiality agreement, which means that I am legally forbidden to speak of content of any of the calls which I captioned. The work was interesting at times and reasonably dull otherwise. There was a sort of strange initial appeal to listening to people's phone conversations without one side of the conversation knowing (it is explained to the customers during the installation of the phone that the service is made possible by real people who caption the calls, though generally those whom the customers are speaking with are not aware of this). Because of this, I heard plenty of interesting, very <em>human</em>, conversations. Most calls were mundane business, routine conversation, or familial gossip. Others might be strange, confusing, vulgar, or completely unintelligible. The captioners are also forbidden to communicate with the customer through the captions, which led to some interesting situations. My favorite part about the job was that we were allowed to do various things on the computer while we were not on a call. I worked the evening shift, so particularly in the late hours, I had plenty of time to work on various things.<br />Working at CaptionCall indirectly had a large impact on my life. For starters, the option to transfer to the center in Tucson invited my first experience of living on my own. I moved to Tucson having neither family nor friends there, and had plenty of adventures along the way. On a more subtle level, working at CaptionCall developed within me an intense awareness of my own language. I grew fascinated with hearing just how much of what we say and think is derived and recycled from culture. I was still a bit young, and drew from this newfound knowledge a direction of dissension from my culture. I monitored everything I thought and/or said to people and made efforts to detach myself from expressions which I considered negative or ineffective. This is something which continues to this day, as I remain very conscious of the communication around me.</p>),

I had a friend who recommended this job to me (she worked there and thought that I'd do well), so I got the job and moved to Salt Lake City. For the record, this was at one of two call centers for Guitar Center Online, the company's website. I met some wonderful people there, got some incredible deals on musical merchandise (to me, that was the most valuable "perk"), and was reminded once again that <span className="italic tracking-tighter font-bold">sales is a poor choice of department for me</span>. Customer Service I can handle, though sales in particular is less than my forte. I initially worked on the phone team, though they created an online chat team during my time there, and I joined to try it out. I was certainly capable of maneuvering the chats, though I found the experience of handling five-to-six simultaneous conversations to be incredibly uncouth. I switched back to the phone teams as soon as I could.</p>),

Our relationship blossomed, despite the distance, though her country was (/is) undergoing extreme political and economical collapse. I had a strong desire to help my partner escape the environment she was facing. I saved as much as possible for some time. We intended to move in together in a country which was foreign to the both of us, as a veritable test of our relationship and the strength of the love we felt from afar... And so it was that after quitting Guitar Center I went on an inadvertent adventure through a few Central American countries. Within these years I met my partner (now-wife), later my son was born, at which point we were stranded in Mexico when COVID appeared, and we all returned to the US together in March 2021, where we remain. Shortly after returning I enrolled in Launch School.</p>),

                (<p>This is a text-based Tic Tac Toe in a console. I made it during the section on Object Oriented Programming in the Launch School curriculum. I found Tic Tac Toe (especially playing it hundreds of times during development) extremely bland. I considered ways of making it more interesting. I improved the visual presentation, making the tiles and marks larger, and allowing the player to change their letter mark (instead of only Xs and Os). There are many more settings I added (you can even watch two computer players compete), though the most interesting addition is a new game mode which I called, 'Shift Tac Toe'. In this, every few turns (also configurable), the board will "shift" all tiles simultaneously in a single direction. This adds a degree of randomness and surprise which can change the tide of a game in a moment. Let it be shouted from the heavens: Tic Tac Toe no longer suffers from the predictable strategies of old! And there was much merriment made, for this was good.<br/><span className="text-xs">The code itself may be a little messy though. That's old work. More a relic than anything else.</span></p>)
