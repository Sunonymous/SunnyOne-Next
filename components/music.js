            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>I have played, composed, and dreamed through music for much of my life. I am blessed to be exploring the piano and improving my skills regularly. My interest in making music right now is purely for the joy of expression and learning, so I lack plans to formally organize the music at this time. Still‚Äîsome have expressed interest in hearing my music, so I will provide a place to listen here.</p>
            <p>Originally I intended to have a &quot;Sunny Radio&quot; built into this website... and then I realized how much bandwidth that might consume. Hobby hosting plans combine poorly with lots of bandwidth usage! Please consume (bandwidth) responsibly. üßê</p>
            <p>For now, I will link to two older EPs I recorded.</p>
            <p>I wrote these under the musical moniker Brightnine (which I have since abandoned). Here is a link to the first EP, the <a className="font-semibold underline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ttabyoh1knjzw9e/space-ep.zip?dl=0">Space EP</a>, and another to the second, <a className="font-semibold underline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wzxqazf7mumamo0/songs-to-burn-to.zip?dl=0">Songs to Burn to</a>.</p>
            <p>I may share some piano snippets here too, if the inspiration finds me!</p>
