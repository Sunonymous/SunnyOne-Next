               It&apos;s quite simple. There are {facts.length} facts present in its database right now. Just press the button and it will show you three facts at a time.
               Fortunately for everyone, it won&apos;t show you the same facts twice unless you press the reset button. 
               And pleaseâ€”relax. There&apos;s no quiz. My wife made me remove it.</p>
